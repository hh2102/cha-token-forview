                    The relaxed, carefree image of the ChillGuy dog is going
                    viral, with returns exceeding a thousandfold. The

                  <h2>Origin</h2>
                  <p>
                    The character of "Just a Chill Guy" (CHILLGUY) originated
                    from the cartoon created by artist Phillip Banks in 2023.
                    The character, embodying a relaxed and nonchalant
                    personality, perfectly aligns with the current trend of
                    "lying flat" (a term in Chinese culture representing a
                    passive resistance to societal pressures). Its expression
                    seems to continuously convey the message: "Why worry? Take
                    it easy." Leveraging TikTok, the character quickly gained
                    popularity, particularly among Gen Z, resonating emotionally
                    with young users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even more surprisingly, ChillGuy has entered the market,
                    both mentally and financially, teaching us all to "take it
                    easy." In just a few days, CHILLGUY brought returns of over
                    100 to 1000 times for enthusiasts and holders.

                    The concept was first introduced on Pump.fun
                    (https://pump.fun/coin/Df6yfrKC8kZE3KNkrHERKzAetSxbrWeniQfyJY4Jpump),
                    a well-known PVP platform. It was deployed two months ago by
                    user @mrowl. As shown by the list of holders, the initial
                    distribution of tokens was very fragmented and PVP-oriented.

                    After two months of inactivity, CHILLGUY went live on
                    Raydium at 4 AM on November 16, 2023, Beijing time, with a
                    deployment price of $0.0000781. In the first hour, the
                    trading volume was approximately 689.8K.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first wave of price increase occurred at 9 AM on
                    November 20, with a 108.15% rise in just one hour, and
                    trading volume surged to 42.25 million. Subsequently,
                    CHILLGUY maintained strong performance throughout November
                    20 and reached a short-term peak of $0.5139 at 1 AM on
                    November 21, with trading volume dropping to 18.3 million.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At its peak price and external market deployment price, the
                    yield reached an astonishing 658,000%, or 6580 times the
                    initial investment. The internal exchange return might have
                    been even higher. Social media engagement also peaked during
                    this period.

                    According to data from GMGN, there are no explicitly flagged
                    "pump-and-dump" addresses in the token holder list. However,
                    several phishing wallet addresses have been identified.
                    Early buyers have mostly completed their profit-taking and
                    portfolio rebalancing. Additionally, the token's 2.6%
                    blue-chip ratio suggests that most token holders are meme
                    players who enter and exit quickly. A critical point is
                    that, despite the memeâ€™s popularity, the creator of the
                    "Just a Chill Guy" character has shown little interest in
                    associating it with the token. They have publicly stated
                    that they do not wish to be linked to the project, which
                    introduces some level of controversy and risk.
